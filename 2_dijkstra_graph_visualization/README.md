# Dijkstra Graph Visualization Program

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates the use of
**Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
The program is designed for academic purposes and demonstrates basic
graph processing, shortest path calculation, and visualization using
Python.

## Features

-   Display a weighted undirected graph
-   Calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
-   Visualize nodes and weighted edges
-   Highlight the shortest path in a different color

## Graph Structure

The graph consists of the following nodes: - **A** (Node A) - **B**
(Node B) - **C** (Node C) - **D** (Node D) - **E** (Node E) - **F**
(Node F)

Each edge between nodes has a weight representing distance or cost.
