# Python Labs

This repository contains a collection of Python practice projects
(*labs*) created for academic and learning purposes. Each folder
represents a standalone exercise focusing on a specific concept in
Python programming, data processing, or algorithms.

The projects are intentionally kept simple, structured, and
well-documented to support learning, experimentation, and future
reference.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Dataset Sorting Using Pandas

A simple Python program that demonstrates: - Data manipulation using
pandas - Sorting by single and multiple columns - Menu-driven
interaction via terminal

### 2. Dijkstra Graph Visualization

A Python program that demonstrates: - Graph modeling using NetworkX -
Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm - Graph
visualization with Matplotlib

## Requirements

Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file. Install dependencies
per project using:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> It is recommended to use a virtual environment when running each lab.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository
2.  Navigate into the desired project folder
3.  Install dependencies
4.  Run the Python script inside the `src/` directory

Example:

``` bash
cd 1_sorter_using_pandas
python src/dataset_sorting.py
```

## Purpose

This repository is intended for: - Academic assignments - Practicing
Python fundamentals - and Learning data processing and algorithms
